<h1>South Africa</h1>

<p class="general_info"><b>Country name: </b>Brazil</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>GDP: </b>$11,500 (2020 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Population: </b>57,516,665 (2022 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Sustainable Development Index: </b>108 (Rank) 63.72 (Score)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Happiness Index: </b>91</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Current carbon footprint: </b>7.34 tonnes</p>
<br><br><br>

<p class="general_info"><b>How did we get there?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">According to Carbon Brief (2018), South Africa is the world’s 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs). A variety of variables contribute to South Africa's CO2 emissions. South Africa's primary source of CO2 emissions is the energy industry, which comprises power generation, transportation, and the industrial sector. South Africa is primarily reliant on coal for energy generation, a fossil fuel that emits a considerable quantity of CO2 when burned. In reality, coal accounts for over 85% of South Africa's electrical generation. This is a significant source of CO2 emissions in South Africa. The transportation industry also contributes significantly to South Africa's CO2 emissions. The country has a huge number of automobiles on the road, and the combustion engines in these vehicles emit CO2. Finally, South Africa's industrial sector contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. Manufacturing, mining, and agriculture are among the industries that make up the country's extensive and diversified industrial base. As a result of their operations, all of these industries can generate CO2 emissions.</p>
<br><br>
  <p class="general_info"><b>What is being done about it?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">According to the Climate Action Tracker (2022), “while it still needs to take action to meet its strengthened climate target, South Africa is making some progress on policies that address the current energy crisis and its severe social, economic, and environmental implications.” The administration announced a new and bolder 2030 goal range in October 2021, but domestic policies and their successful execution will require an additional push to fulfil it. The new aim reflects a major departure from the prior target, and it serves as an example of how countries may gradually boost their mitigation ambition. Despite being a step forward, the new aim is still incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C.</p>
<p class="intro_cause">Considering South Africa’s highly impactful energy sector, the government made two optimistic statements in response to the present energy situation. President Ramaphosa announced more efforts to alleviate South Africa's electrical problem in July 2022. These include potentially game-changing steps to stabilise and decarbonize South Africa's power grid, such as eliminating licensing requirements for distributed energy generation and dividing state-owned utility Eskom into three organisations for generating, transmission, and distribution.</p>
