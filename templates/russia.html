<h1>Russia</h1>

<p class="general_info"><b>Country name: </b>Russia</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>GDP: </b>$26,500 (2020 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Population: </b>142,021,981 (2022 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Sustainable Development Index: </b>45 (Rank) 74.07 (Score)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Happiness Index: </b>80</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Current carbon footprint: </b>12.10 tonnes</p>
<br><br><br>

<p class="general_info"><b>How did we get there?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">Russia is now the fourth greatest emitter of greenhouse gases, after only China, the United States, and India. Additionally, it produces around 7% of the total CO2 emissions in the globe, ranking it as the third-highest emitter ever. Coal, fossil gas, and oil are responsible for the majority of Russia's greenhouse gas emissions. About 12 tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually per person, which is more than double the global average. Permafrost, even in the summer, covers around two thirds of Russia. This permafrost has the ability to emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as global temperatures increase. Significant effects of climate change are already being seen in Russia, including frequent and devastating wildfires, especially in Siberia. Russia might become "a vital partner in global climate action" because of the size of its mineral resources and agriculture production, according to some academics. However, its leaders haven't yet demonstrated any inclination toward establishing a bold climate policy.</p>
<p class="intro_cause">According to the IEAâ€™s global methane tracker, Russia is the second biggest source of global energy-related methane emissions. Despite pleas for the government to intervene, the nation's gas infrastructure, including its producing facilities and pipelines, is infamously leaky. The Russian coal mines also emit a substantial amount of methane.</p>

<br><br>
  <p class="general_info"><b>What is being done about it?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">A National Adaptation Plan for 2022 was authorised by the Russian government in 2019. In addition to crisis preparations like immunizations in case of an emergency or evacuations in case of a disaster, it offers 30 actions such as dam construction or transitioning to more drought-resistant crops. According to this, permafrost is under danger due to climate change, and illnesses and natural catastrophes are more likely. The "good impacts of climate change" are also mentioned. For instance, "decreasing energy usage during the heating season, improving the circumstances for cargo transportation in the Arctic waters, and boosting animal husbandry efficiency." According to climate envoy Edelgeriyev, adaptation in Russia has been "unfairly overlooked."</p>
<p class="intro_cause">However, after the COP26 talks, Russia has committed to have net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2060. The majority of Russia's Energy Strategy until 2035 is dedicated to encouraging the exploitation of fossil fuels. Nonetheless, Russia continues to make relatively little effort to combat climate change. Its few pertinent initiatives either lack ambition or have a hazy expectation of changing emissions. The country's current policies show that it has no actual intention of reducing emissions.</p>
