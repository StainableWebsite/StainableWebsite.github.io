<h1>Germany</h1>

<p class="general_info"><b>Country name: </b>Germany</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>GDP: </b>$50,900 (2020 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Population: </b>84,316,622 (2022 est.)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Sustainable Development Index: </b>6 (Rank) 82.18 (Score)</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Happiness Index: </b>14</p>
<p class="general_info"><b>Current carbon footprint: </b>8.09 tonnes</p>
<br><br><br>

<p class="general_info"><b>How did we get there?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">According to Angela Cullen (2022), “Europe’s largest economy released the equivalent of about 762 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2021, a 4.5% increase from the previous year.” The main reasons for it include the higher emissions in the energy sector. Germany has failed to meet its emissions goals for the past two years. While demand was recovering from epidemic lows last year, Russia temporarily stopped supplying natural gas to Europe, forcing the continent to switch to coal and even fuel oil to keep the lights on. The amount of fossil fuels burned to produce energy increased, which increased emissions.</p>

<p class="intro_cause">About 27 million tons of the extra 33 million tons of CO2 produced last year came from the energy industry as a result of increased demand brought on by the recovery from the coronavirus epidemic. While rising gas costs drove suppliers to rely more on coal, poor wind conditions resulted in a 7% decrease in renewable energy.</p>
<p class="intro_cause">For Germany to reach its target of obtaining 80% of its power from alternative sources by 2030, wind and solar energy development must be increased by three times.</p>

<br><br>
  <p class="general_info"><b>What is being done about it?</b></p>
<p class="intro_cause">The German government has vowed under the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the new Climate Action Act (Klimaschutzgesetz) to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. The program's main focus is a new CO2 pricing structure for the heating of buildings and the transportation industry. As a result, we are raising the cost of carbon dioxide emissions in these industries. In the transportation industry, we are promoting the use of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient structures, and alternative engine technologies. Germany is cutting out the use of coal to produce power and placing its reliance on renewables as part of its response to climate change; this drive to put Germany's energy supply on a more sustainable path is referred to as the energy shift or energy transition. Renewable energy sources are expected to supply 65% of total power demand by 2030. All power production and use must be greenhouse gas neutral by 2050. By far, the most significant renewable energy source is wind power. Just over 50% of the overall electricity produced by renewable sources in 2019 was derived from wind power. According to the terms of the Offshore Wind Power Act, the installed capacity of offshore wind farms is to be increased to 20 Gigawatts (GW) by 2030 in order to give the energy transformation initiative greater momentum (Windenergie-auf-See-Gesetz). Overall, Germany is pursuing the goal of Germany and Europe becoming climate neutral by 2050, and they are supporting all necessary guidelines (such as the European Commission’s European Green Deal) to reach it.</p>
